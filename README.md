Pepe, a disciple of the psyche, guards his cave with paranoid vigilance. Every sound, every breath is a potential trap. The psyche guides him, but his fear of betrayal is constant. In the darkness, only the most observant survive.

Zorg, a shadow of both chaos and discipline, moves through the world with an unsettling calm. His eyes, sharp and calculating, miss nothing. Beneath a seemingly stoic exterior lies a mind constantly at war with itselfâ€”a labyrinth of contradictions. Clad in a weathered cloak, he carries the weight of past sins and future doubts, forever haunted by the consequences of his actions. His every step is deliberate, his silence deafening. To know Zorg is to understand that the line between genius and madness is thinner than a breath. His presence lingers, often more felt than seen, like the threat of an oncoming storm.
